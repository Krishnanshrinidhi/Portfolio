# Music Store SQL Analysis & Tableau Analysis Presentation
In this Music Store SQL & Tableau Analysis project, data analysis was performed on the Superstore Data available to uncover insights into the store's sales trend and glen meaningful information that the company can use to further its business, such as promotional activities, stock up on popular artist/genre etc.
After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the sales trends were visualized by region wise, customer, genre and artist. Additionally, least-performing regions were identified and the top spending customers in the regions were identified. After, the data is displayed in a Tableau interactive dashboard. Analysis below provided valuable insights into the Music Stores sales performance and identified areas for improvement. The project demonstrated the usefulness of SQL in data analysis and decision-making.
